##2. Basic differential amplifier

### AIM :

Design and Analyze the MOS differential amplifier circuitfor the following specifications

###  Components Required:

N-MOSFET(nmos4),Resistor(1.9k,0.4k),Power Supply(DC:2.2V, 1.2V),Current source(1,mA),Signal generator

### basic differential amplifier

A differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two input signals. It rejects common noise and is used in signal processing. It is a key part of op-amps and instrumentation
circuits.
