# EXPERIMENT - 1
Question: Given the power as P=100Âµw, Perform AC, DC and Transient analysis for the given circuit design by using Ltspice simulator.

### CIRCUIT DIAGRAM-1:



### PROCEDURE 
BY using the power formula P=V*I
we get the drain current as,Id=5.55e-005A
### 1. DC Analysis
Go to simulate, Select the dc output print and the run the simulation.



below figure shows the output of dc analysis



### AC analysis

Go to simulate, select this AC analysis Give the value as shown below and run the simulation
