### Result:
* The calculated drain current from the DC analysis was 5.55e-005A, achieved with NMOS dimensions: Length = 175nm, Width = 178nm.
* The circuit maintained stable performance across the tested frequency range.
* The circuit responded well to variations and ensured stable operation

### Inference:
* The drain current helps determine whether the MOSFET is operating in the saturation region.
* The MOSFET's operating region depends on the gate-to-source voltage (VGS).
* Coupling and bypass capacitors significantly influence the frequency response.
* The gain of the circuit is directly influenced by the MOSFET parameters.
* To perform the simulation, specific component library files must be added to the simulation software.
* Adjusting the length and width of the MOSFET allows for precise control over the drain current in the simulation.
