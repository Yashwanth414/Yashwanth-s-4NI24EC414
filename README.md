##2. Basic differential amplifier

### AIM :

Design and Analyze the MOS differential amplifier circuitfor the following specifications

###  Components Required:

N-MOSFET(nmos4),Resistor(1.9k,0.4k),Power Supply(DC:2.2V, 1.2V),Current source(1,mA),Signal generator

### basic differential amplifier

A differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two input signals. It rejects common noise and is used in signal processing. It is a key part of op-amps and instrumentation
circuits.

### Types of differential amplifier

A basic differential amplifier takes two input signals and finds the difference between them.It makes this difference bigger while ignoring any common noise in both signals. If one input is higher, the output goes positive; if the other is higher, the output goes negative. If bothinputs are the same, the output is zero.
